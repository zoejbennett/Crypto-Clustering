# Crypto-Clustering
Using unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

This project utilizes K-means clustering techniques to analyze market changes in cryptocurrency models. The code analyzes the effectiveness between analyzing the original dataset using K-means clusters compared to using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 

These are the yielded results, with the original normalized results on the left, and the PCA results on the right.
